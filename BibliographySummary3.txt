Tesla racalled 53,822 vehicles with full self-driving software due defects. The AI was not working as intended, for example, when the car encounters a stop sign, instead of making
a full stop, it does a rolling stop. The self driving software also had occasional difficulties detecting other vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians. Fortunatly, there have been
no recorded collisions, injuries or fatalities related to the self-driving feature.

 The metaverse has become mainstream ever since it was announced by Meta, a company that was once called Facebook, which is  switching some of its focus away from social media
 and into virtual and augmented reality. One must understand what these technologies are and their differences. Virtual reality is where a completly virtual world is generated, 
 with no influence from the real world. However, augmented reality combines aspects from the physical world and some virtual aspects as well. For example, Zoom is a very popular
 video application to conduct meetings in. If zoom had an augmented reality feature, instead of the users being seen on a screen, they could be seen in the same room as if it was
 an in-person meeting.
