Apple Opens Digital Driver's License and State ID Program, Starting With Arizona:

Apple is on its way to replace real world physical wallets even more by introducing digital drivers license and state ID program in the Apple wallet. This will be beta
tested in Arizona. Apple says the new state ID will work just like a physical one, including at the TSA checkpoint at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport to start.
Apple says its program relies on the same "secure element" hardware it's designed for storing credit cards, biometrics and other sensitive data.

 Google will test letting Android developers use their own billing systems, starting with Spotify:
 
 Google is introducing a program to allow thrid party payments to be made on applications. These payments will be done outside of the Google Play Store. Spotify will be 
 the first and will use both Google Play’s billing system and its own. “This pilot will help us to increase our understanding of whether and how user choice billing works
 for users in different countries and for developers of different sizes and categories,” Google’s Sameer Samat. We will see how Apple responds to this move. Maybe Apple
 will do it soon as well.
