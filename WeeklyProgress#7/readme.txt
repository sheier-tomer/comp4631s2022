Weekly Progress #7

3/23/2022

Group: Tomer Sheier and Mohmmadazhar Khalifa

This week we have created a concept for the school profile, in this case the example is Umass Lowell. These school profiles are where the users are going
to spend most of their time on the app.

Next week we will create multiple profiles for schools with working buttons for categories.
