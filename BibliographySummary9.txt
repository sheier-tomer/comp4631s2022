Apple Begins Allowing Some Apps Signups to Link Outside App Store:

Apple has been forced to settle with Japan's fair trade commission to will allow "reader" apps like streaming services more leeway in how they sign up 
customers. Apple told its developers that they can now allow external links for account signup for their applications, being outside of the App Store. 
Netflix and Spotify have been in many conflicts with apple about their signup systems being only through the App Store, committing to their mission of 
tight control of apps in the store. We have been seeing many companies in conflict with apple due to their tight control, and we have seen Apple losing the
fight and backtracking.

 A New Law Would Force Facebook Messenger and Apple iMessage to Talk to Each Other. Here's How:
 
 A new European Union legislation is aiming at apps like  WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Apple's iMessage to let their users communicate with one another.
 The legislation is called the Digital Markets Act, whichs calls on the major apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Apple's iMessage, and wants them 
 to open up and operate with smallar apps like signal, discord, and telegram. The requirements in the legislated are as follows: Allowing third-party 
 services (like messenger apps) to interact with gatekeeper systems, Letting users access services they may've acquired outside of a gatekeeper platform,
 and enabling users to uninstall any pre-installed software or apps. There are also many more requirments.
