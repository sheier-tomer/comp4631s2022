1) "Apple vows to collect App Store commission even through alternative payment systems"

Many countries and regions are forcing Apple to diversify ways for IOS users to download their apps. People have been confined to only one source, the App Store, which also 
collects 30% commission from sales in the platform. Netherland's Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM), ordered Apple to allow dating apps to have alternative systems for 
payment that are outside the App Store. Apple appealed this order and claimed that this will breach user privacy and security. Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) warned 
Apple that clause 3.1 in the Apple Store Guidlines breaches Russian antimonopoly legislation. The clause prohibits IOS developers from informing users about possible purchases 
that can be made outside the App Store. Apple now charged 15% commision from sales for most developers.
