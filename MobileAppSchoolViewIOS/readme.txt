Short Report:
School view is an app project that allows college students rate certain aspects of their school, being for example, academics, athletics, housing, dining,
and much more. This allows students to voice their concerns or praises of these aspecst, giving a star rating and also adding a comment. This app also 
allows high school seniors to see ratings of a college they are applying to, allowing them to see if the school is the right fit. 

Installation:
To use these files, the machine must have XCode installed (only on Mac), and must install every file due to there being external libraries being used in
the development process.

App Instructions:
When launching the app, the user is greeted with a log in or sign up page. If login is pressed, it will take the user to the main page. If sign up is 
pressed, the user is taken through the sign up process. Everything else about the app is self explanatory. Account setup does not work yet, we need to setup firebase for that.
