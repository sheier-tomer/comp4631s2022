 Netflix Testing New Feature to Combat Password Sharing:
 
 Netflix is planning combating account sharing by adding sub accounts to people's profiles. This will only combat against people sharing their account with
 people that are not in the same household. For around $3, users are able to add 2 additional subaccounts to their Netflix account. Personally, I do not
 think this will stop anyone from sharing accounts, this just seems like a cash grab by Netflix from some customers.
